# AI-with-memory

Made a small project where i made two different AI models, both running on `gemma2:9b`

They are on different branches, so in order to have an AI with either short or long term memory, use the respective branches.

please run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
before running the program. 
And make sure you have `gemma2:9b` installed as well:
```bash
ollama run gemma2:9b
```

Also you should have setup a `MongoDB` in order for long term memory to use. You can find it here: https://www.mongodb.com/
